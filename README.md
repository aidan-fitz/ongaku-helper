Ongaku Helper (<ruby>音 <rp>(</rp> <rt>おん</rt> <rp>)</rp> 楽 <rp>(</rp> <rt>がく</rt> <rp>)</rp></ruby>ヘルパー) is a simple app for practicing Japanese song lyrics.

The core feature will be a web page where you can paste in Japanese text and it will automatically annotate the kanji with [furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana) (ruby text). This is helpful for Japanese learners who wish to use song lyrics to learn. Japanese song lyrics on the web are often displayed with the original text without furigana, the rōmaji, and an English translation side by side or on different tabs. This is inconvenient because users who can't read the kanji need to alternate between reading the original and the rōmaji in order to learn the pronunciation.
